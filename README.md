## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed. If not, you can install it with:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### 2. Then, install the project dependencies by running:

```bash
 pnpm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

pnpm run dev
```

This command will start the development server and provide you with a URL where you can view your project in the browser.
